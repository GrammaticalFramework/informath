# Informath: Informalization and Autoformalization of Formal Mathematics

(c) Aarne Ranta 2025

## The Informath project

The Informath project addresses the problem of translating between formal and informal languages for mathematics. The original picture is the following:

![Informath](./informath.png)

Informath started in early 2024, but it has a background of a long tradition of translating between formal and informal languages by using GF, Grammatical Framework. New relevance for this task has been created by recent attempts to "teach mathematics" to Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. These contemporary systems, such as Google's AlphaProof, combine machine learning (e.g. large language models) with formal proof systems, to guarantee the correctness of results. In this context,

- **autoformalization** is automatic translation from informal to formal language
- **informalization** is (automatic) translation from formal to informal language

An insight that has guided GF from the beginning is that informalization is easier than autoformalization, because it goes from a restricted, semantically explicit formal notation to an open-ended, semantically often implicit natural language. Recent developments in AI have suggested something similar: one can "train" language models to formalize by providing them data generated by automatic informalization. Informath can become a useful source of such data. But its primary purpose is to help the users of formal proof systems to create and document their content.


## The languages Core, Dedukti, and ForTheL

This directory contains
- Core, an English CNL for mathematics
- a grammar, parser, and generator for the proof system [Dedukti](https://deducteam.github.io/)
- a translator from Core to Dedukti and vice-versa

[Dedukti](https://deducteam.github.io/) is a minimalistic logical framework aimed as an interlingual between different proof systems such as Agda, Coq, Isabelle, and Lean.
The purpose is to help share formalizations between these systems.
Dedukti comes with an efficient proof checker and evaluator.
Translations from many other proof system to Dedukti have been built, and this work is ongoing.

Technically, Dedukti is described as an implementation of Lambda-Pi-calculus with rewrite rules.
It is similar to Martin-LÃ¶f's logical framework from the 1980's, except for a more liberal syntax of rewrite rules.
Thereby, it is also similar to the ALF system of 1990's and to the abstract syntax of GF, Grammatical Framework.

Due to its simplicity and expressivity, together with an existing implementation and conversions, Dedukti is a promising choice for the "core type theory" in the Informath project, whose original picture is shown above.

In the same way, the Core language defined in this directory is meant to be the "core abstract syntax" of Informath.

In the current set-up, the translations go between Core and Dedukti, ignoring the extensions shown in the above picture. This may indeed be the best way to go. On the type theory side, translations have already been established between other frameworks and Dedukti, and there is no need to extend the interlingual type theory for the purpose of these translations. On the natural language side, the option we will investigate is to keep Core and "extensions" as two separate languages, where the extensions are provided by the [ForTheL](http://nevidal.org/download/forthel.pdf)-based [grammar](../forthel/) in "version 2" of this project. This gives us an updated picture of Informath:

This directory covers the "formal" and "informal" boxes and "informalization" and "formalization" operations. ForTheL+ refers to the GF implementation of ForTheL that adds some extensions and is open for new ones to cover more of mathematical language.It differs from the original ForTheL in a few ways:

- **Grammaticality**: ForTheL+ follows the agreement rules of English (and other languages) instead of allowing free variation of e.g. singular and plural forms; this makes it better usable as the target of informalization.
- **Ambiguity**: ForTheL prevents syntactic ambiguities by means of devices such as brackets. ForTheL+ tries to capture all syntactic ambiguities that exist in natural language, and delegates it to the logical framework to resolve them by semantic clues. This is in line with the findings in [*The language of Mathematics*](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-642-37012-0) by Mohan Ganesalingam.
- **LaTeX**: The original ForTheL is plain text, whereas ForTheL+ (like some other later versions of ForTheL) allows the full use of LaTeX similar to usual mathematical documents; this is one of the
- **Extensions**: ForTheL+ is open for extensions with new forms of expression when encountered in mathematical text. Because of the design of Informath, every extension should be equipped with a new semantic rule that converts it to Core.
- **Omissions**: ForTheL+ is not guaranteed to cover all of the original ForTheL. In particular, constructs that differ from grammatical English are usually omitted.
- **Multilinguality**: ForTheL+ has several concrete syntaxes sharing a common abstract syntax. 

As we will see, the Core language shares some features with ForTheL+: grammaticality, LaTeX support, and extensibility (with a lexicon). But the other features are delegated to ForTheL+ via the NLG function.

## The design of Core

Core is a minimalistic grammar for mathematical English. It is based on the following principles:

- **Completeness**: all Dedukti code can be translated to Core.
- **Non-ambiguity**: all Core text has a unique parse tree and a unique translation to Dedukti.
- **Losslessness**: Core is a lossless representation of Dedukti; that is, all Dedukti code translated to Core can be translated back to the same Dedukti code (module some differences yet to be specified).
- **Traceability**: Dedukti code and Core text can be aligned part by part.
- **Grammaticality**: Core text is grammatically correct English (with mathematical symbols and some mark-up to prevent ambiguity). 
- **Naturalness**: Core supports natural expressions for mathematical concepts using nouns, adjectives, verbs, and other structures conventionally used in mathematical text.
- **Extensibility**: Core can be extended with lexical information assigning English verbalizations to Dedukti identifiers.

The following propertes are, however, *not* expected:

- **Type correctness**: Core text can be semantically invalid, leading to syntactically correct Dedukti code that is rejected by Dedukti's type checker.
- **Fluency**: Core text can be repetitive and even hard to read; making it better is delegated to ForTheL+ via the NLG component.
- **Compositionality**: The translation between Dedukti and Core is not compositional in the strict sense of GF, as the two languages have different abstract syntaxes. For example, Core supports the aggregation of conjuncts and function argument lists, without which it would be even less readable; and the basic type system is richer than in Dedukti, for instance distinguishing between expressions that represent kinds, objects, and propositions.
- **Natural language input**: while the grammar of Core is reversible, it is tedious to write Core. It is intended to be produced indirectly: by conversion from Dedukti on one hand and ForTheL+ on the other.
- **Multilinguality**: Core has been implemented by GF RGL and is therefore ready for concrete syntax in other languages than English. But since the purpose of Core is not to be the end point, we deem it sufficient to build CoreEng and cover other languages via ForTheL+.

The rationale of this design is modularity and an optimal use of existing resources:

- Type checking is delegated to Dedukti.
- Conversions to different frameworks are also delegated to Dedukti.
- Variation of natural language input and output is delegated to ForTheL+.
- Support for different natural languages is also delegated to ForTheL+ (and, ultimately, to GF RGL).

## Implementation

The following programming languages have been used so far in Informath:
- **GF**: [Grammatical Framework](https://www.grammaticalframework.org/) used for implementing Core and ForTheL+, maximally using its Resource Grammar Library (RGL).
- **Haskell**: used for writing conversions between formal and informal, via embedded GF grammars in the GADT format (Generalized Algebraic Datatypes) supporting almost compositional functions.
- **BNFC**: [BNF Converter](https://bnfc.digitalgrammars.com/), used for implementing Dedukti. The implementation includes a parser, a printer, and an abstract syntax in Haskell, all generated from [this BNF grammar](./typetheory/Dedukti.bnf).
- **Python**: used for generating GF lexica from term dictionaries, in particular [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/). The lexica are currently available as a part of ForTheL+, but the English version will have a connection to Core as well. 

## Usage

It is too early to document the usage of this software, because its user interface has not yet stabilized.
The emerging interface is in the file `Informath.hs`. Its two main modes are interactive shell and conversion of Dedukti files to Core:
```
  $ runghc Informath.hs <file.dk>?
```
The shell has following functionalities:
```
  > <dedukti_jmt>  # convert Dedukti to Core
  > ?<core_jmt>  # convert Core to Dedukti
  > =<dedukti_jmt>  # roundtrup Dedukti to Core to Dedukti
  > gr  # generate random Core jmt and convert to Dedukti
```
In order for this to work, you need to compile the Dedukti and the Core grammars:
```
  $ make Core.pgf
  $ make Dedukti
  $ ln -s typetheory/Dedukti
```
An example of readily available test case is
```
  $ runghc Informath.hs nat.dk
```
If you pipe this to `grep -v "#"`, you can see the bare Core output.

## ToDo

- complete the two conversions (Dedukti2Core.hs already close to complete, but can make better use of the Exp/Kind/Prop distinction)
- make the lexicon part (files Constants*) dynamically generatable; now you need to edit all these files if you want to change the lexicon and recompile Core.pgf
- link Core with ForTheL+ 
- for the purpose of autoformalization: find or build conversions from Dedukti to the back-end proof systems; they are deemed to be partial, and we plan to start with just definitions and theorem statements, postponing the proofs
