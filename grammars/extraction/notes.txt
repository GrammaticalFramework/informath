Build UD treebank:

cat ~/informath/gf-math/data/qenu.tmp | ./deptreepy.py txt2conllu >qen.conllu

Notice: qenu.tmp nees empty lines between text lines.

From udpipe1_params.yaml:

model: english-ewt-ud-2.12-230717
# other params to come, see https://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/services/udpipe/api-reference.php

see https://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/services/udpipe/api/models

For German, select first german-hdt-ud-2.12-230717,
then german-gsd-ud-2.12-230717, which turns out to be better.

Get words and lemmas from CoNLLU

cat qde.conllu | cut -f2,3,4,6 | grep -v '# ' | sort -u >qde-words.tsv

Unknown words extraction:

cat ../../data/qde.tmp |  python3 extract_terms.py Ger >wde.tmp

with the last line uncommented in the .py file
This gives us 1716 unknown words

GF file extraction:

   python3 words_from_ud.py >dew2.tmp


   python3 words_from_ud.py | grep "fun " | sort -u >MathWordsGerAbs.gf
   python3 words_from_ud.py | grep "lin " | sort -u >MathWordsGer.gf 

Then add appropriate headers to these files. Obtain 909 words.
Test in GF an fix a few things until it compiles.

Add MathWordsGer to the inheritance of ExtractGer and compile.

Now, try term extraction again:

cat ../../data/qde.tmp | python3 extract_terms.py Ger


Residual words guessed as proper names obtained by

  cat ../../data/qde.tmp | python3 extract_terms.py Ger unknownsPN | grep "fun " | sort -u >funs.tmp
  cat ../../data/qde.tmp | python3 extract_terms.py Ger unknownsPN | grep "lin " | sort -u >lins.tmp

and pasted to MathWordsGer

Merging the results into a table with QId, Eng, Ger, Cat, Englin, Gerlin:

  python3 merge_terms.py

So many were lost in both, Eng, and Ger, respectively:
  
  python3 merge_terms.py | cut -f4 | grep LOST | wc
     808     808    4040
  python3 merge_terms.py | cut -f5 | grep LOST | wc
    1335    1335    6675
  python3 merge_terms.py | cut -f6 | grep LOST | wc
    2900    2900   14500

The cat is unified to the smallest common cat of the two languages, however, wrapped to CN if it is N.

An optional argument gives different behavious: print actual GF files, and dump a json dict:

  python3 merge_terms.py gf
  python3 merge_terms.py json
