## all of the predicted Agda theorems parse correctly with 'agda' command, but they have type errors
## common reason: uses of infix operators like ==, +, > are not supported by vanilla Agda but assume some library.
## they are predicted repeatedly, so the base model must have got them from somewhere. Maybe from Lean?
