def sphenic : (p : Elem Nat) -> Prop := p =>
  exists Nat (k => exists Nat (m => exists Nat (n =>
    and (and (and (prime k) (prime m)) (prime n))
      (and (and (Lt k m) (Lt m n))
        (Eq (times (times k m) n) p))))).

theorem : Proof (forall Nat (p => if (sphenic p) (forall Nat (n => (Neq p (square n)))))).
